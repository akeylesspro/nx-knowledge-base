    "story": "akeyless-types-commons is a foundational shared library that centralises all domain-level TypeScript definitions for the Akeyless vehicle-tracking platform. It defines the canonical shapes for entities such as cars, clients, sites, users, equipment, boards, GPS events, socket communication, credit management, and feature-flag enumerations. By publishing these definitions as a standalone package, every consumer (server, client, mobile, toolbox) works from the same source of truth, eliminating type drift between services.",
