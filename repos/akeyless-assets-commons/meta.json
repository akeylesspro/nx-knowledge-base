    "story": "akeyless-assets-commons is the centralised visual asset library for the Akeyless fleet management platform. It houses all inline SVG constants and JSX components used across the client applications: coloured vehicle map-marker icons for nine vehicle types (car, bus, truck, jeep, crane, forklift, motorcycle, scooter, bicycle) each in four ignition/speed-derived colour states; dashboard warning icons for standard OBD faults; general-purpose UI icons such as map markers, flags, and action buttons; and React components including CarPlate, IlPlate, UsPlate, and GoogleSvg. Helper utilities for licence-plate formatting, compass bearing calculation, and Tailwind class merging are also included. The library exposes a single entry point so consumers can import any asset with a single import statement.",
